You'll need at least 4 terminal windows.
In each, first navigate to ~/learning_feedback_linearization/ros, then type 
	./baxter.sh asimov (or archytas or ayrton)
There will be an annoying dialog that asks you for your name. Just ctrl-C
Then type
	source devel/setup.bash

In one terminal window, type
	rosrun baxter_tools enable_robot -e
This unlocks the robot, and you'll need to run it everytime you e-stop the robot

In another type
	rosrun baxter_learning start_joint_trajectory_action_server.py
(use tab-complete). This starts the internal controller and unlocks the control interface

In another type
	roslaunch baxter_moveit_config demo_baxter.launch left_electric_gripper:=true
set the right/left electric gripper args based on the grippers on your robot. The default is false.
After the first time you run this, you can instead run
	roslaunch baxter_moveit_config move_group.launch left_electric_gripper:=true
which doesn't open rviz.

Finally, in another window, type
	roslaunch baxter_learning sw.launch learning:=true

Hitting ctrl-C should stop the robot, but use the e-stop in a dangerous-seeming situation. Never use ctrl-Z to stop your process. If things seem really broken, you can use ctrl-\ but then your data won't save.
